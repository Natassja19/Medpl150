    <h1>Reading 1 Reflection</h1>

    <p>
        "Photographs are grammar and, even more importantly, an ethics of seeing." At first thinking of photography as a way to capture memories and document events is common, 
      but the author argues that it's much more complicated and powerful than that. It shapes how we see the world, how we experience events, and even how we understand reality itself. 
      Photographs don't just show us things, they shape our sense of what deserves attention and train us to notice certain things we wouldnt have noticed before. 
      The author says that we are still "reveling... in mere images of truth," suggesting that we mistake photographs for reality when they are only representations. We are satisfied with
      with the picture of things instead of the real thing. A photograph is not the event, the place, or the person, it's just a flat image of one moment, from one angle, chosen by someone.
      Seeing a photo is not the same as understaning it, "We can hold the whole world in our heads - as anthology of images," esentially says, because we see so many pictures everywhere we start 
      to think you've seen the whole world, but realistically you've only seen a collection of of images, not a real understanding. This really relates to social media today when something major
      happens, like a war, act of violence, or something political, the first thing people usually see is a photo or video on Instagram or TikTok. Many people feel they understand the situation 
      just by seeing the images and may repost, comment, or argue about even though they may not have the full context, history, or details behind what happened.

    <p>
      Another important idea is that taking the photograph is not neutral, "To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed," and that it gives a feeling of knowledge and power. 
      This implies that the act of photographing is a way of controlling or possessing a moment, person, or place. Even when photographers claim to simply "capture reality," they are making 
      choices about what to include, what to leave out, and how to present it. The example of the Farm Security Administration photographers taking multiple until they got "the precise expression
      ...that supported their own notions" shows that photographs are interpretations, not pure truth.

    I was especially stuck by the idea that photographers can actually make us less sensitive to suffering over time. The author explains that while images of war, poverty, and tragedy can 
    shock us at first, repeated exposure to these kinds of photographs can cause emotional us to become emotionally numb. "Images transfix. images anesthize." This means that photographers grab 
    our attention and can also dull our emotional response. The more we see disturbing images the more normal they begin to feel. Which is crazy because instead of motivating people to care or take action, 
    photographers can make serious problems seem distant and unreal. This makes me think of how often we scroll past upsetting images pn social media without really processing them. What once might 
    have seemed shocking slowly just becomes another picture in a feed, showing how photography can reduce our empathy rather than increase it.

    I would represent Sontag's ideas by showing a person carefully staging a scene just to take a photograph, basically arranging coffee or pastry with a cute table cloth and workspace, to look perfect
        for social media. The image on the phone would look aesthetic while the background messy and artificial, connecting to the author's quote, "A way of certifying experince is also a way of refusing it."
        because the person is more focused on on dreating the image than actually enjoying the moment. It also reflects the idea that photographs shape what we think is worth looking at, since the person is
        designing reality to fit what will look good in a picture rather that living naturally.

        Reading this piece left me with alarm and resignation, like watching a familiar world slowly warp into something cartoonish 
        right before your eyes. The core idea is that our social feeds are being flooded with the author “AI slop” which isn't just 
        about low quality images or funny memes, it’s about a deep distortion of our collective sense of reality. 
        The term itself might seem silly at first, conjuring up kitchen mess more than technological ruin, but the more I 
        think about it, the more apt it feels. Malik isn’t just talking about a few silly cat images, but she’s describing and 
        entire parallel visual world running alongside the real one, one that’s increasingly difficult to separate from truth
        <p> 
        
        </p>
    What hits hardest is the sense that this flood of AI-generated content isn’t a random glitch or creative whim. 
    It’s being driven by big tech’s relentless pursuit of attention and profit. Algorithms don’t care whether something is accurate, 
    thoughtful or real, they care whether it keeps eyes glued to screens. So the weird, the sensational, the bizarre, that’s what rises 
    to the top and gets shared. Malik’s idea that AI content saturates everything from public timelines to private WhatsApp threads really 
    brought home just how inescapable this is. It’s not confined to big platforms, it seeps into personal conversations where we’re least critical. 
    <p> 
    
    </p>
    There’s a subtle but frightening suggestion here too that when AI content starts feeling “normal,” our 
    instincts for skepticism dull. If you come across a bizarre video of a politcal figure in an impossible situation or a dramatic scene 
    in a foreign conflict and it looks convincing enough, you might assume it’s real. It’s no longer just a meme, it’s a potentially
    misinformation with emotional pull. What Malik describes is a world where trust erodes because the visual cues, we’ve relied on for 
    centuries are no longer reliable. A picture, one thought evidence of reality, becomes just another layer of nonsense.  
    <p> 
    
    </p>
    This isn’t to say all AI content is evil or useless, but the article’s real point, I think, is about balance and awareness. 
    When the majority of what we see is engineered by unseen systems, optimized for clicks and profits, we risk losing touch with context 
    and consequence. The critique isn’t anti AI, it’s a warning about structure, who controls the algorithms, what the reward, and how 
    little human oversight truly exists shaping the narratives we consume. It makes me wonder whether we’ll reach a tipping point where people 
    actively reject algorithmically generated noise in search of human metric meaning. 
    <p>
        
    </p>
    What I took from this was that we should form our own opinions, be aware of what we’re watching and consuming. 
    Social media was meant to connect us, I think that can easily be taken the wrong way if we’re fed misinformation by AI, 
    and result in steering us apart. Drowning out connections can push us to misunderstand the world. Furthermore, if we lean to rely 
    heavily on AI to be a conduit for human connection we may lose our ability to truly interact and create in a meaningful and genuine way.
