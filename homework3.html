  <h1>Homework 3: Depth of Field</h1> 
 
  <p> 
    For Homework 3, I posted 4 JPG images total on this single page (homework3.html): 
    a shallow depth of field photo, a deep depth of field photo, a Photoshop blur version, 
    and the original image used for the blur comparison. All images are under 2 MB and saved 
    in the <b>images</b> folder. 
  </p>

          I used Filter &gt; Blur Gallery &gt; Field Blur to blur the background while keeping the subject sharp.

          This is the original image before applying the Blur Gallery filter.

  <h2>Reflection (about 250 words)</h2> 
  <p> 
     For this assignment I focused on photographing a subject that would clearly demonstrate the difference between shallow
    and deep depth of field. In the shallow depth of field image, I wanted the subject to stand out sharply against a soft, 
    blurred background. In the deep depth of field image, my goal was to keep both the subject and the background details in 
    focus so the entire scene felt clear and visually connected. Through the process, I learned how dramatically depth of 
    field changes the mood and focus of an image and with shallow depth of field, the background became blurred and 
    less distracting, which directed attention directly to the subject. In contrast, using a higher f-stop increased the 
    depth of field, keeping more of the scene share and intentional because the viewer could clearly see the environment.  
Aperture played a major role in my results, like when I used a wider aperture, more light entered the camera and the plane of focus became narrow which required careful focusing. I used contrast, highlights, shadows, whites, and blacks sliders to refine the tonal range and create better balance.
