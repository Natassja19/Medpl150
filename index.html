<h2>Creative Statement:</h2>
    
<p>My name is Natassja, and I'm a first year Media Studies major. I'm very drawn to media because of how relevant and influential it is in today's world. Media shapes how people communicate, share ideas, and understand the world around them, and I think it's important to learn. How it works both creatively and critically. One of the reasons I chose this major is because of it's broadness, exploring different areas within media will help me find where I'd like to focus on in the future. I have always enjoyed being creative and experimenting with different forms of expression. Art has been an important part of my life, and I especially love working with collage. I enjoy the process of combining images, textures, and ideas to create something thoughtful and expressive. I am excited to see how my interest in art and collage connects with visual communication and interactive design. I look foraward to learning new tools, techniques, and ways of thinking that will help me turn my creativity into clear and effective visual messages. I'm excited to develop me skills and try new approaches throughout this course.<p></p>
