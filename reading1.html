    <h1>Reading 1 Reflection</h1>

        "Photographs are grammar and, even more importantly, and ethics of seeing." At first thinking of photography as a way to capture memories and document events is common, 
      but the author argues that it's much more complicated and powerful than that. It shapes how we see the world, how we experience events, and even how we understand reality itself. 
      Photographs don't just show us things, they shape our sense of what deserves attention and train us to notice certain things we wouldnt have noticed before. 
      The author says that we are still "reveling... in mere images of truth," suggesting that we mistake photographs for reality when they are only representations. We are satisfied with
      with the picture of things instead of the real thing. A photograph is not the event, the place, or the person, it's just a flat image of one moment, from one angle, chosen by someone.
      Seeing a photo is not the same as understaning it, "We can hold the whole world in our heads - as anthology of images," esentially says, because we see so many pictures everywhere we start 
      to think you've seen the whole world, but realistically you've only seen a collection of of images, not a real understanding. This really relates to social media today when something major
      happens, like a war, act of violence, or something political, the first thing people usually see is a photo or video on Instagram or TikTok. Many people feel they understand the situation 
      just by seeing the images and may repost, comment, or argue about even though they may not have the full context, history, or details behind what happened.

      Another important idea is that taking the photograph is not neutral, "To photograph is to appropriate the thing photographed," and that it gives a feeling of knowledge and power. 
      This implies that the act of photographing is a way of controlling or possessing a moment, person, or place. Even when photographers claim to simply "capture reality," they are making 
      choices about what to include, what to leave out, and how to present it. The example of the Farm Security Administration photographers taking multiple until they got "the precise expression
      ...that supported their own notions" shows that photographs are interpretations, not pure truth.

    I was especially stuck by the idea that photographers can actually make us less sensitive to suffering over time. The author explains that while images of war, poverty, and tragedy can 
    shock us at first, repeated exposure to these kinds of photographs can cause emotional us to become emotionally numb. "Images transfix, images anesthize." This means that photographers grab 
    our attention and can also dull our emotional response. The more we see disturbing images the more normal they begin to feel. Which is crazy because instead of motivating people to care or take action, 
    photographers can make serious problems seem distant and unreal. This makes me think of how often we scroll past upsetting images pn social media without really processing them. What once might 
    have seemed shocking slowly just becomes another picture in a feed, showing how photography can reduce our empathy rather than increase it.
