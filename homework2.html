  <h1>Homework 2: Reflection on Photography and Photoshop</h1>

    <p>
      For this project, I honestly didn't realize how much small edits could completley
      change the way a photo feels. At first, I thought cropping was just about cutting 
      things out, but once I started working in Photoshop, I understood that cropping is 
      more about directing attention. In the sink photo, I adjusted it to a 16:9 ratio, and 
      that immediatley made it feel more dominant in the compostion, and the lines of the tiles 
      helped guide the viewers eye across the image, it made it feel more balanced and less random.
      Straightening was also more important than I expected. Even a tily tilt can make an image 
      feel off, especially when there are strong horizontal and vertical lines like tiles or walls.
      Fixing that made the image feel cleaner and more prefessional. Tone adjusmtents were probably
      the biggest change because using brightness and contrast through adjustment layers made the photos
      feel more defines without looking overedited. In the fire hose image, increasing contrast
      made the red stand out more and gave the image more depth. It went from looking flat to lookiing
      sharper and more focused. I also notice how tone affects mood, for explample the brighter
      tones can feel cleaner and more open, while stronger contrast can make something feel more
      dramatic. Overall, this process made me realize that editing isn't about fixing a bad photo, it's 
      more so about enhancing what's already there and make your composition choices clearer. 
      Photoshop feels less intimidation now and more like a tool to control the story of the image.
